Short Introduction

Agriculture remains the backbone of rural communities, and rice production is particularly vital in ensuring food security and economic stability. However, pests and diseases continue to threaten crop yields, creating challenges for both farmers and agricultural institutions. AgriExpert is a mobile application designed to address these issues by integrating modern technology with practical field use. Powered by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the application enables real-time detection of rice pests and diseases through image analysis using smartphones. Beyond detection, it provides management guidelines, weather and mapping integrations, and a collaborative platform where farmers, experts, and the Municipal Agriculture Office can interact seamlessly. By combining advanced image recognition with accessible mobile technology, AgriExpert seeks to empower farming communities with timely solutions, informed decisions, and stronger expert support.
